RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! You surprised me, much like the Seedot that just fell from that tree over there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_1
TEXT: It really scared a Pidgey that was foraging nearby, and I’m pretty sure it did that on purpose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_2
TEXT: It’s easy for Seedot to trick people and Pokémon alike because Seedot are almost indistinguishable from acorns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_3
TEXT: Are they appearing in higher numbers right now, or am I seeing double? Could you help me investigate this nutty situation?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were away, I was just refreshing my memory on Seedot.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_1
TEXT: Apparently, it attaches itself to a tree branch using the top of its head and sucks moisture from the tree it’s hanging from. The more water Seedot drinks, the glossier its body becomes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_2
TEXT: Thanks, Seedot, for reminding us to stay hydrated! Did you know that Seedot can evolve? AHHH! Sorry, I was just startled by another one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_3
TEXT: Why don’t you try evolving Seedot? Maybe it’ll get calmer and stop playing pranks on everyone!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_0
TEXT: On the one hand, fantastic work, Trainer. Your little Seedot has evolved into Nuzleaf, the Wily Pokémon. On the other hand, our plan to calm Seedot down by evolving it has backfired.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_1
TEXT: Apparently, Nuzleaf can make a flute out of the leaf on its head, and the sound of that flute strikes fear and uncertainty into the hearts of people who hear it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_2
TEXT: I’m sorry. But I have faith that a brave Trainer like yourself can handle Nuzleaf just fine!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_3
TEXT: Maybe if we try evolving it again...its next form will be less scary! Personally, I’ve been startled enough for one day of research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_0
TEXT: So...your Nuzleaf has evolved into Shiftry, the Wicked Pokémon. Unfortunately, upon reviewing data on Shiftry, I learned it can be quite fearsome, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_1
TEXT: Using its leafy fan, Shiftry can create wind gusts with speeds of up to one hundred feet per second. That’s strong enough to level houses! I think I need to go tie my mobile lab down!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_2
TEXT: I’d rather be surprised by a Seedot than blown away by a Shiftry! Hah...lesson learned—stay up-to-date with Pokémon, even familiar ones!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_3
TEXT: Thank you for your help researching this odd occurrence. Once these winds die down, I’ll be in touch about our next research adventure!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_0
TEXT: Hi there, %PLAYERNAME%. I can’t help but be impressed by your progress. You’ve done fantastic work in researching Pokémon originally discovered in the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh regions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve researched Pokémon that were found in those regions...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_2
TEXT: let’s take a closer look at Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_3
TEXT: I think it’s fascinating that even though we know a lot about Pokémon from all over the world, there’s always more to learn!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_4
TEXT: Speaking of discoveries, I’ve been doing some additional research and heard about an interesting phenomenon that has to do with Meowth in the Galar region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_5
TEXT: I was speaking to a researcher who’s the granddaughter of a colleague from Galar, and she shared some intriguing information.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_6
TEXT: It seems that Galarian Meowth lived with seafaring people, which toughened their bodies so much that parts of them turned to iron.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_7
TEXT: Maybe I could get a few workout tips—I’ve been looking for some ways to toughen up myself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_8
TEXT: Anyway...let’s do some more research on Pokémon originally discovered in Unova, but be sure to keep your eyes open for other exciting discoveries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, Trainer. You might be familiar with the tradition in which a Pokémon Trainer selects their very first partner from a group of three Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_1
TEXT: These first-partner Pokémon are normally Fire, Water, or Grass types. In Unova, many Trainers choose the Water-type Oshawott as their first-partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_2
TEXT: This Sea Otter Pokémon is known to use the scalchop on its stomach during battle. Isn’t that just adorable? Please continue your research, and let me know your findings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_0
TEXT: I can’t stop thinking about how cute Oshawott is... Oh! You’re back! Excellent work catching that Darumaka!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve researched the Water-type first-partner Pokémon of many Trainers from Unova, let’s shift focus to the Fire-type one—Tepig!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_2
TEXT: I’m a particular fan of Tepig because it uses the fireballs that come from its nose to roast Berries. It’s such a clever use of a skill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_3
TEXT: I just love roasted Pinap Berries! We should continue our work and see what else we can discover.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_0
TEXT: Being the savvy Trainer you are, I’m sure you know which type of Pokémon we’re going to research next.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_1
TEXT: That’s right—Grass type! In Unova, many Trainers choose the Grass Snake Pokémon Snivy as their first partner. Snivy is intelligent and calm, and being exposed to lots of sunlight makes it move more swiftly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_2
TEXT: Perhaps there’s a lot we could learn from such a sagacious Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_3
TEXT: Anyway, let’s get started on these research tasks. Be sure to listen carefully, as you never know what you might encounter!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_0
TEXT: You’re a natural, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m so glad we could research some of the amazing Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_1
TEXT: I can’t thank you enough for your hard work. I hope you put this Charged TM and Fast TM to good use!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_2
TEXT: By the way, I literally stumbled across a mysterious Pokémon I’ve never encountered before.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_3
TEXT: I think you’re the perfect Trainer to take this Pokémon and help it reach its potential. Best of luck, and I’ll be in touch soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Are you experiencing this incredibly bizarre situation? I stepped out of my mobile lab this morning to see needle-like horns poking out of the grass all around me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_1
TEXT: Luckily, I saw that big red nose also poking out and realized they were just Weedle, the Hairy Bug Pokémon. I guess you could say we’re in a...hairy situation. 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_2
TEXT: ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_3
TEXT: Weedle’s horn measures in at about 2 inches, is sharp, and, most importantly, is toxic. It acts as a sharp stinger that injects poison! Let’s investigate this situation further, but watch your step!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_4
TEXT: I know some of you think you’ll have better luck while adventuring if you go barefoot, but I wouldn’t advise this considering there are Weedle with needles everywhere!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_0
TEXT: Nice footwork, Trainer. A fascinating tidbit I read when you were completing your tasks was that a Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_1
TEXT:  It distinguishes its favorite kinds of leaves from those it dislikes by sniffing with its big, red, and, in my opinion, honkable nose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_2
TEXT: I can think of a number of times this useful skill would have come in handy, especially when the team leaders start sharing snacks around the lab and haven’t thought to offer me any.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_3
TEXT: Anyway, I think that we should look further into Weedle’s evolution. I can’t wait to see what other fascinating details we learn.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_0
TEXT: Well done with that evolving, %PLAYERNAME%. However, it looks like the evolved form of Weedle, Kakuna is just…sitting there. I knew the Cocoon Pokémon didn’t move much, but wow,

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_1
TEXT: seeing it in person has made me realize that...it really does just sit there. Though it seems like it’s doing nothing, it’s actually extremely busy on the inside as it prepares for its coming evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_2
TEXT: This is evident from how hot the shell becomes to the touch! Isn’t that exciting? There was so much happening beneath the surface that we would’ve never known if 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_3
TEXT: we hadn’t started researching Weedle! Let’s keep going! I think that Kakuna of yours is ready to show you what it’s been working on.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_0
TEXT: Your Weedle has tried so hard and got so far! And in the end, it’s reached its third evolution with three poisonous stingers and wings that allow it to fly quickly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_1
TEXT: Talk about a glo up! Beedrill, the Poison Bee Pokémon, is known for being extremely territorial. These creatures sometimes attack in swarms and nests of them in the wild are considered very dangerous!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_2
TEXT: Beedrill is a powerful Bug- and Poison-Type Pokémon that may surprise you if used in Trainer Battles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_3
TEXT: Thanks for your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll be in touch once I figure out how to maneuver my mobile lab out of this area, I fear I might get a flat tire from all of these needles crawling about!
