# Pokemon GO Assets
Repository of all mined assets including sprites, sounds, and news items. This repo is organized based on category and is a combination of downloaded/remote assets and assets found inside the APK.

**Note:** This repo does **NOT** contain all assets found within the game, only the assets we have mined.

## Folder Structure
### Images

All 2D images of all assets that we mine are located here. Assets are organized based on category such as `Pokemon`, `Items`, `Backgrounds`, etc.

### 3D Assets

All 3D models and their textures (if present) of all assets that we mine are located here. Assets are organized based on category such as `Pokemon`, `Items`, `Clothing`, etc.

### Sounds

All sound effects and music that are mined are found here. They are organized by category such as `Pokemon Moves`, `Music`, `Menu Sounds`, etc.

### Texts
Mined text assets which contain quests among other things will be found here. Inside there are two folders, one for `Latest APK` and one for `Latest Remote`. When Niantic pushes a text update, it's pushed to the Remote. Once a new APK is released, all remote pushes are merged into the APK and removed from the Remote; therefore, we maintain both.

**Note:** Keep in mind it is expected that the Remote will have items removed from it after a new APK is released.

### News
All datamined news images and texts from the In-Game News will be found here. There will be two folders: one for images and one for texts. In Texts, the file called `CurrentNews.tsv` will contain the most recent news file and the `Old News Texts` will contain a history of older news texts. Keep in mind each tsv contains all current news in the game.

### Shop Images
Any images that are displayed in the shop that we datamine.
